Release Process
===============

Oro Product Versions
--------------------

Oro products are following `Semantic Versioning`_ strategy (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) with a few additions:

- MAJOR version number reserved for backward incompatible architecture and technology changes
- MINOR releases include new features and clear migration path in case of small backward incompatible updates
- PATCH version releases are used for bug fixes and minor improvements

Release Cycle
-------------

Oro Team is working on multiple products and releases them based on different models:

- MAJOR and MINOR versions release is feature driven
- PATCH version release is time based on monthly basis

.. note::

    We issue PATCH version releases only for latest MINOR version of the Community Edition of our products and to
    three latest MINOR releases of Enterprise Edition.
