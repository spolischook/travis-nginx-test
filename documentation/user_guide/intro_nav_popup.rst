Flash Notifications and Dialog Windows
======================================

While using OroCRM, you may sometimes need to inform a user about some events in the system. For example, when an 
operation has been executed or has failed, or they need to be reminded about a task or event.

Success flash messages are displayed against a green background:

|

If something has gone wrong, the flash message will be displayed against a red background in order to attract your 
attention.

|

.. image:: ./img/navigation/popup/flash_error.png

|

Other flash messages have a yellow background.

|

Sometimes, a flash message can contain links to other pages, such as the task reminder above, or this synchronization 
message:

|

|

Flash messages appear on the top of the screen for several seconds and then disappear.

If the user must make a decision before the system can go on, a dialog window will appear. The dialog windows have 
buttons and will not disappear until a decision has been made:
