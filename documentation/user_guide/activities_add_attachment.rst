Add Attachment
==============

You can add an attachment to a record in OroCRM.

.. note::

    Attachments are available only for the entities, for which they are :ref:`enabled <user-guide-activities-enable>`.
    
.. hint::

    The attachment settings depend on the specific 
    :ref:`entity settings <user-guide-entity-management-create-attachments>`.


Add Attachments
---------------

Once a record has been created, an attachment can be added from its View page.

.. caution::

   The ability to view and write attachments depends on the :ref:`permissions <user-guide-user-management-permissions>` 
   defined for the entity.

- Go to the record View page.

- Click the *Add Attachment* action.

    :ref:`roles <user-guide-user-management-permissions>` that enable management/viewing of the owner's attachments will 
    be able to manage/view the attachment.
