Calendars Overview
==================

Efficient business today is hard to imagine without an easy-to-understand and up-to-date schedule. 
OroCRM provides each user with a calendar with tasks and events related to the specific user, to other users 
(subject to the :ref:`roles and permissions defined <user-guide-user-management-permissions>`), as well as to events 
defined for the whole organization or system.


.. _user-guide-calendars-tasks-events:

Tasks and Calendar Events
-------------------------

You can :ref:`create task <user-guide-activities-tasks>` and 
:ref:`create calendar events <user-guide-activities-create-events>`.

Each task/event will have an owner (user, who has created it and other users, subject to roles and permissions defined) 
and the user, to whom the task/event has been assigned.

.. _user-guide-calendars-system:

System and Organization Calendars
---------------------------------

Events in the System and Organization calendars can be viewed and processed by all the users within the 
system/organization, unless these is restricted by their 
:ref:`roles <user-guide-user-management-permissions>`.


Create System and Organization Calendars
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Go to the *System → System Calendars*.

- Click the :guilabel:`Create System Calendar` button.

- The *"Create System Calendar"* :ref:`form <user-guide-ui-components-create-pages>` will appear:

Define the following fields

.. csv-table::
  :header: "Field", "Description"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "**Calendar Name***","This is the only mandatory field. Defines the name used to refer to the calendar in the system."
  "**Color***","Choose the color used to highlight events in the calendar by default."
  "**Scope***","Define if this is a system or organization calendar (meaningful for enterprise edition only)."

For example, we have created a System Calendar "Sales update meeting" that will displayed at the yellow background:

      |
  
.. image:: ./img/calendars/create_system_cal.png

|

Click the button in the top right corner to save the calendar. 

To add an event to the calendar:

- Go to the :ref:`View page <user-guide-ui-components-view-pages>` of the calendar.

- Click the :guilabel:`Create Calendar Event` button.

- The *"Create Calendar Event"* :ref:`form <user-guide-ui-components-create-pages>` will appear. The form has the 
  following fields:

.. csv-table::
  :header: "**Name**","**Description**"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "**Title***","The event name. Must be defined."
  "**Description**","A free text field that you can use for additional information about the event"
  "**Start***","Time the event starts. Must be specified." 
  "**End***","Time the event ends. Must be specified."
  "**All day event**","Defines whether the event will take place for a whole day."
  "**Color**","Defines the color to be used to highlight the event when displayed in the calendar."
  
For example, we have created an event "Weekly report" event that will take place on July 16, 2015 from 3:35 to 4:35 PM.
The event will be highlighted as defined for the calendar by default.

Tasks and Calendar Events on the User's Calendar
------------------------------------------------

A convenient way to see and manage available tasks and calendar events is the User's Calendar. In order to see it:

- Go to the user drop-down menu (near the user name)   

  |UserMenu|

- Click *"My Calendar"*

- The calendar will appear

.. image:: ./img/calendars/user_calendar.png

Initially, the calendar (1) will contain all the events and tasks assigned to you, events and tasks of system and 
organization calendars available to you, as shown in the list of items displayed in the calendar on the left (2).


Add and Manage Calendar Items Displayed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the items by default displayed in the calendar the following actions are available:

- Hide from the calendar
- Edit color

.. image:: ./img/calendars/user_calendar_edit.png

If you want to add the items from a calendar of another user (permitted to you), click the drop-down menu (3). All the
users whose calendars are available to you will be in the drop-down.

.. image:: ./img/calendars/user_calendar_add_user.png

For example, we have added calendar of Ellen Rowell. It has appeared in the items list and in the calendar. 
Events from calendar of Ellen Rowell are highlighted blue.

For the items added to the calendar, additional option "Remove calendar" is available.
