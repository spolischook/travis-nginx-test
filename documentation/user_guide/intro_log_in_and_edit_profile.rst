.. _user-guide-intro-log-in-edit-profile:

Log in, View Your User Page, and Set up Your Profile
====================================================

To get to your OroCRM account, enter the OroCRM instance url.

.. image:: ./img/intro/login.png

.. hint::

    The *"login using google"* option may not be available for your organization, check with your OroCRM Administrator.
    
    
.. _user-guide-getting-started-log-in:

Log in
------

Your administrator will determine this but typically upon your user account creation you will receive an email with your 
login credentials. In order to log in to the system for the first time, type in the username and password specified in 
the email. In order to save your credentials on a device, check the *"Remember me on this computer"* box before you log 
in.

.. caution::

    It is strictly recommended to change your password immediately after the first login. You can learn how to do it in 
    the :ref:`Changing Your Password sectio n<user-guide-getting-started-profile-password>` below.

If you have forgotten the credentials, click the *"Forgot your password?"* link and follow the wizard to restore them.


Log in Using Your Google Credentials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the Google Single Sign-On capability has been enabled for your organization, you will see the *"login using google"* 
link at the login screen. This means you can log in using your corporate Gmail account credentials. Usually this 
capability is enabled for corporate email addresses only, so your personal mailbox credentials won’t do.


Log in Using Other Corporate Credentials 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OroCRM can be set up to accept your existing corporate login and password. This is possible if your organization 
utilizes a common server to share them across multiple applications. This is referred to as LDAP integration. Please 
check with your system administrator to see if this is the case.


.. _user-guide-getting-started-my-user:

Access Your User Page

     If synchronization with an external SMTP server has been enabled for an external mailbox (as described in the

     your addressee will always see the address of the synchronized mailbox as the *"from"* field value.

|

You have to:

- Type in your current password

.. _user-guide-intro-log-in-edit-profile-synchronize:

Synchronize Your Mailbox with OroCRM
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Emails can be sent from user to user within OroCRM and outside OroCRM using internal OroCRM SMTPserver. However, most 
OroCRM users already have some external mailbox used for work-related purposes. You can synchronize this mailbox with 
your mailbox in OroCRM in the *"Email synchronization settings"* section.

|

.. image:: ./img/intro/email_sync_1.png

|

To synchronize your existing mailbox with your mailbox in OroCRM, go the the *"Email synchronization settings"* section.

OroCRM can be synchronized with any IMAP/SMTP servers. A dedicated *"Gmail"* synchronization is available to simplify 
synchronization with Gmail-based accounts. 

If synchronization with an IMAP server has been defined, all the emails from synchronized folders of the external 
mailbox will be available to you in *"My Emails"* in OroCRM. If If synchronization with an SMTP server has been defined, 
all the emails sent from OroCRM will be available in the external mailbox.

Please note, that if SMTP synchronization has been enabled, your addressee will always see the mailbox address as the 
*"from"* field value.

.. note::

    If no synchronization has been enabled, emails received from other OroCRM users will appear in the *"Activity"* 
    section of the *"My User"* page but not in *"My Emails"*. Emails from a synchronized mailbox can be reached from the 
    both.

Synchronize with any IMAP/SMTP Server
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""    

The functionality can be used to synchronize any IMAP/SMTP server with your mailbox in OroCRM. 

- Select the Account Type - *"Other"* (if available). If this is an only option enabled for the system, the selector 
  won’t be displayed - skip the step.
  
  |
  
  |EmailSync2|

  |
  
* In order to **receive emails** from the external mailbox in OroCRM:

  - Check the *"Enable IMAP"* box.

  - Provide your IMAP credentials: host, port, and encryption type (contact your administrator for assistance).

- In order to **synchronize emails sent** from OroCRM in to the external mailbox:

  - Check the *"Enable SMTP"* box.

  - Provide your SMTP credentials: host, port, and encryption type (contact your administrator for assistance).

.. hint::

    If you choose not to enable SMTP synchronization, you will still be able to send emails from OroCRM, but they won’t 
    be synced with the email server and you will not see them in other email clients (such as Outlook or Gmail web 
    interface). We strongly recommend to enable SMTP at all times.

* In order to **finish the synchronization**:

  - Provide your access credentials: your login/username (usually the email address itself) and password used to access 
    the mailbox.
   
  - Click the :guilabel:`Check Connection/Retrieve Folders` button. 

  - Once connection has been established , you will see the list of folders. Check the folders you want to synchronize 
    with OroCRM.

  - Save the user profile.

Syncing with Gmail
""""""""""""""""""

You may use the generic IMAP/SMTP synchronization described above for your Gmail account, however,you must allow access 
for *"less secure apps"* in your Gmail settings first. (Please see detailed instructions 
`here <https://support.google.com/mail/troubleshooter/1668960?hl=en&rd=1#ts=1665018%2C1665144>`_.) 

To avoid this step and improve security we strongly recommend to use the dedicated functionality described below.
This section applies to both @gmail.com customers and Google Apps customers.(Check with your email administrator if you 
doubt).

- Select the Account Type - *"Gmail"* and click the :guilabel:`Connect` button that appears below.

  |
  
  |EmailSync3|
  
  |
  
.. note::

    This option is only available if your OroCRM instance is connected with a Google Apps account. Please check with 
    your system administrator if you want to enable Gmail synchronization for your account.

 - If you haven’t used a Google account in your browser (or if its cache has been cleared), the Sign-in form will appear. 
   Use it to log in to your account.

   |
  
   |EmailSyncGM1|

   |

 - If you are using several Gmail accounts in your browser, you will see a list of them. Select the account for which 
   you want to enable synchronization with OroCRM, then log in (if necessary).
   
   |
   
   |EmailSyncGM2|
   
   |
   
 - As soon as you are logged into a single Gmail account, you need to let OroCRM view and manage your mail, and give it 
   offline access to your mailbox.
   
   |
   
   |EmailSyncGM3|
   
   |EmailSyncGM4|

   |
   
.. hint::

    Make sure that pop-up windows from your OroCRM instance are not blocked.


- After the connection has been established, you will see the connected account name (your email address) and the list of 
  folders that can be refreshed with the :guilabel:`Retrieve Folders` button.

  |
  
  |EmailSyncGM5|
  
  |
  
Select the folders you want to synchronize and save your user profile. The synchronization will start immediately, but 
the full sync can take a while depending on the size of your mailbox.

Change the Synchronized Mailbox
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you want to change the mailbox you sync with OroCRM, simply change the IMAP/SMTP credentials for generic IMAP sync, 
or remove the connected Gmail account, change your primary email address, and sync with Gmail again.

.. caution::

    If you change the synced mailbox, all emails from the previous mailbox will be deleted from OroCRM.   
    
Configuring Mailboxes in the Multi-Organization Environment
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you want to work with email in :ref:`multiple organizations <user-guide-getting-started-change-organization>`, you 
have to configure a mailbox for every organization. You can synchronize different external mailboxes or the 
same external mailbox for your user in different organizations.


Save the Changes
----------------
Click the :guilabel:`Save and Close` button in the top right corner to save the changes to your profile and return to 
the *"My User"* page.

Logout
------

Go to the User Menu in the top right corner of the page, and select the *"Logout"* item.
