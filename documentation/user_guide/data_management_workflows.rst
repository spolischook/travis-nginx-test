Following a Workflow
====================

In the process of the work with the customers information saved in the CRM system can be changed: carts turn 
into orders, what seemed to be a potential opportunity appears not to be worth effort or tuns into a successful deal, 
customer support requests are processed and closed, and so on.
These and other processes are reflected in OroCRM with creation of new records, change of record properties and 
creation of new relations. (For example - a new lead appeared, and while processed, it was related to a customer and a 
contact, and turned into a new opportunity. 

In many cases success of the business depends a lot on the unity of the procedures followed all through the company.
How many times can you call a customer? Can you close an opportunity as lost without an explanation? What should you do 
if a customer has added some goods to the cart but hasn't ordered them?

In OroCRM there can be defined workflows, that system users should follow in order to process entities. For example, a 
workflow for processing an abandoned cart (when a customer has added at least one item but has not purchased 
anything) will allow a manager to convert the cart into an order at any moment, but will not let set a cart to the 
“abandoned” status until the customer has been contacted successfully.

In a technical language, a a workflow is a sequence of industrial, administrative or other processes applied to a 
piece of work from the initiation to completion that can be defined for records of specific type.

This article is aimed to provide the understanding of workflows and ways to follow them. The way to create workflows is 
described in the part of the guide sharpened for the system administrators.

Workflow Components 
-------------------

Steps and Transitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Each of the processes or actions applied to a record is a *workflow transition* and the state of this record before or
after a transition is a *workflow step*.

Each transition connects two steps.

In the example below you can see a simple workflow of a document creation.

The **workflow steps** are "Start" and squares (In progress, Under review, Finished) and correspond to the state of the 
document. 

.. _user-guide-worfklow-start-step:

**Start step** is used only to specify the first condition (basically the record is in the "Start" step before its \
processing has started.

The **workflow transitions** are the arrows that show what action can be applied to the document at a certain step.


Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^ 
Attributes is another name for properties. For example, ZIP code and 
street name are attributes of an address.

In the course of each transition you can change some attributes of the record processed. For example, document 
attributes may be "Name" that must be defined after transition "Start Writing" and can be changed after transitions 
"Submit for review" and "Return for rework" and "Number of Pages" that must be defined after "Submit for review" and can
be changed after it has recieved the "Approved" status.

Going Through a Workflow
------------------------

If the workflow starts from creation of a record, the transition buttons are available in the top right corner of the 
:ref:`grid <user-guide-ui-components-grids>`.

E.g. :guilabel:`Start From Lead` and :guilabel:`Start From Opportunity` that create a new Lead or Opportunity record
at the start of a Sales Process workflow.


.. image:: ./img/workflows/wf_display_grid.png


Button of all the transitions, for which pre-conditions (if any) are met, are displayed at
:ref:`View pages <user-guide-ui-components-view-pages>` of the entity records.

E.g. :guilabel:`Develop`, :guilabel:`Close As Won` and :guilabel:`Close As Lost` buttons on a View page of a Sales 
Process record qualified to an opportunity.

The current step, or all the steps performed can be displayed on the entity grid, subject to the settings defined for 
the entity in your organization (the *"Entity Management → Workflow Step on Grid"* settings).

.. image:: ./img/workflows/wf_display_step.png


All the performed steps of the workflow are displayed at the **widget** on the top of the View pages of the entity 
records, subject to the *Workflows → General → Show Ordered* and *Workflows → Designer → POSITION* settings.

Conclusion
----------

The workflows will help the system users to make a decision and ensure that they stay within the company-approved 
procedures.
