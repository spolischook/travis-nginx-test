Tools for Marketing
===================

OroCRM's Marketing functionality helps you efficiently organize and monitor marketing campaigns and mailings.

The functionality provides tools for automatic generation of Marketing Lists and their usage for generation of Email 
Campaigns in OroCRM, Dotmailer and MailChimp. Magento Abandoned Cart functionality is a dedicated tool to create lists 
of contacts of customers, who have added an item to a cart in a Magento store but haven't submitted and order. 
OroCRM also provides tools to track the user activity on a website.
All the Tracking and Email Campaign details can be treated independently or aggregated within a Marketing Campaign.
