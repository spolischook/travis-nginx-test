Create a Contact Request from a Third-Party Application
-------------------------------------------------------

Add the code for the form on your site, as described in the :ref:`Embedded Forms guide <admin-embedded-forms>`. 
Use the forms of the "Magento Contact Us Request" type for the Magento-based businesses and of the "Contact Request"
type for the other websites. Every time a user has filled the form it will be added to the Contact Requests grid in
Oro CRM.

.. note::

    Other contact request types can be developed in the course of integration, according to your specific business needs.


View and Manage Contact Requests
--------------------------------

.. note:

    The ability to view and edit contact requests depends on the specific roles and permissions defined in the system. 
   
- All the Contact Requests can be viewed from the Contact Requests grid.
