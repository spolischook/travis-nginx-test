Navigation Basics
=================

 OroCRM provides a broad set of navigation tools that allow you to easily access necessary information and tools. The 
 system helps to ensure that frequent actions can be performed with minimal effort by keeping required information at 
 hand. This means no important updates are missed.

This section provides an overview of the navigation elements in OroCRM.

The Menu Bar
------------

The menu bar is the main mode of accessing data in OroCRM, and is always displayed on every page. Subject to your 
organization configuration, it may be displayed horizontally or vertically. In the latter case, the menu items will be 
displayed as icons.

In the mobile version, the menu bar can be accessed via the "hamburger" button next to the organization name:

The list of menu items that are available to you depends on your access and permission settings, as defined in your 
organization.

Hover the cursor over a menu item to expand the drop-down menu with see the second-level items. Click on them to access 
any corresponding pages or grids. (See :ref:`Data management basics <user-guide-data-management-basics>` for further 
details.)

This way, users can easily access, store, and organize any and all information required to manage customer relations in 
the most efficient way.

Flash Notifications and Dialog Windows
--------------------------------------

Flash notifications and dialog windows are used by OroCRM to notify you about something important.

If just a notification is needed (e.g., to mark the success or failure of an operation, a reminder, etc.), the flash 
message will appear. They may contain links to more detailed information.

If your decision is required, and OroCRM cannot proceed without it, a dialog window will appear and will remain in place 
until you click a button. They usually pop up in order to warn you about something very important or irreversible, such 
as deleting records.

To see examples of flash messages and dialog windows, please read the 
:ref:`Flash Notifications and Dialog Windows <user-guide-intro-popups>` guide.
