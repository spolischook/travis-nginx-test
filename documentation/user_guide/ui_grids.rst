Grids
=====

Grid is a convenient way to see information about all the records of a specific :term:`entity`.

For example, if you choose *System â†’ Channels* in the :ref:`menu <user-guide-menu-items>`, you will see the grid of all 
the channels available:

      |

|

- Rows of the grid represent records of the entity chosen.

- Columns of the grid represent fields of the records.

.. note::

    Availability of fields displayed in the grid depends on the 
    :ref:`roles and permissions <user-guide-user-management-permissions>` assigned to the user, as well the 
    :ref:`Show on Grid settings <user-guide-entity-management-other-common>` defined for fields of the entity. 
    

.. _user-guide-ui-components-grid-filters:
    
Grid Filters
------------

You can apply filters to choose specific items to be shown in the grid. 

Click the arrow on a filter to choose required values. Available value setting depend on the field type. If more than 
one filter is active, only the records that meet requirements of ALL the filters are displayed.
  
In the example below, only the contacts created after the third of November, with "gmail.com" emails and phones that 
start with 123 are displayed:

    Please note that the list of fields available for filters depends on the  *"Show Grid Filter"* settings defined for 
    fields of the the entity. Please see the *Entity Management* guide for more details.
