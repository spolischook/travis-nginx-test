available, the :guilabel:`Update` link will be available in the LATEST VERSION column.

In order to add a new extension:

  :guilabel:`Install` button.

- Confirm the package installation. Uncheck the *"Load demo data"* box, if you don't need demo data. Click 
  :guilabel:`Continue`
  
When installation is over, the package will be added to the Installed Packages list. Relevant 
:ref:`processes <user-guide-processes>` and :ref:`entities <user-guide-entity-management-from-UI>` will be added to the 
system and the functionality can be used.
