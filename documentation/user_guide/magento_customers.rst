Magento Customers
=================

The *"Magento Customer"* records represent clients of a Magento-based store, for which data is collected within the 
channel. The entity must be assigned to a Magento channel.

After the successful :ref:`synchronization with Magento <user-guide-magento-channel-integration>`, the list of 
Web Customers and their details will be loaded to OroCRM and, if 
:ref:`two-way synchronization has been enabled <user-guide-magento-channel-integration-synchronization>` 
can be processed in OroCRM.


Create a Magento Customer Record
--------------------------------

If the two-way synchronization has been enabled, you can create a new Magento customer from OroCRM.

In order to create a new Magento customer in the system:

- Go to the *Customers â†’ Magento Customers*.

- Click :guilabel:`Create Magento Customer` button.

- The *"Create Magento Customer"* :ref:`form <user-guide-ui-components-create-pages>` will appear:

  etc.).
  
  By default, the user creating the record is chosen."

  "**Password**","Define the password for the Magento Customer. Empty password cannot be set."

The optional fields may be left empty.
