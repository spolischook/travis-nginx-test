Processes
=========

Some actions in OroCRM trigger other actions. This behaviour is pre-defined at the background and can be modified in the
course of the system integration. Mostly, this actions are related to :ref:`OroCRM extensions <admin-package-manager>`.
For example, as soon as a new Magento Customer has been uploaded to OroCRM, an account and a record are
automatically created for it, and if a new campaign has been created in a Dotmailer address book synchronized with 
a marketing list in OroCRM, a new Email Campaign record is automatically created in OroCRM.

You can view and activate/deactivate the process in the OroCRM UI.

View Processes
--------------

To view the processes, go *System â†’ Processes*.  

The *"All Processes"* grid contains the following details:


.. csv-table::
  :header: "Name","Description"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "NAME","Defines the process available in the system." 
  "RELATED ENTITY","OroCRM :term:`entity`, records of which are influenced by the process."
  "EXECUTION ORDER","Priority of the process execution. The smaller is the number, the higher is the priority. If 
  several processes have been triggered simultaneously, the processes
  with a higher priority are executed first."
  "ENABLED","If set to *Yes*, the process will be executed."
  "CREATED AT","Date and time when the process was added to the system."
