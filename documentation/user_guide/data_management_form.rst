Forms to Create New Records and Edit Their Details
==================================================

In order to create a new record of an :term:`entity`, or to update details of the existing record, use the dedicated 
Create/Edit forms as described below.

Create a Record
---------------

Click the  :guilabel:`Create {Entity Name}` button in the top right 
corner of the grid to get to the *"Create ..."* form.

- All the editable fields of the entity will be displayed in the grid. 

.. note::

    The list of fields available from the form s defined by the system administrator 
    (:ref:`Show on Form <user-guide-entity-management-other-common>` settings defined for 
    fields of the entity).

- Mandatory fields are identified with a red asterisk.

- If there are several sections, they are displayed one after another and allocated into different tabs.

For example, this is a *"Create Email Campaign"* form:

|

.. image:: ./img/ui_components/create_page.png

|

You can click on a name of the section you need (e.g. *"Email Settings"*), and this section will be 
displayed at the top:

|

.. image:: ./img/ui_components/create_page_tab.png

|

Edit a Record
-------------

To change the properties of a records, use the Edit form. In most cases, the only difference between the *"Edit"* and 
*"Create"* forms is that previously defined field values are already filled in. 

.. note::

    Some of the values cannot be re-defined, subject to the system requirements. 


Form Action Buttons
-------------------

In the top right corner of every *"Create/Edit"* form, you can usually see two Action Buttons:  :guilabel:`Cancel` and  
:guilabel:`Save` or  :guilabel:`Save and Close`.

- If you don't want to save the changes in the system, click :guilabel:`Cancel`. 

- To Save the changes applied and stay on the form, click :guilabel:`Save`.

- To get to the :ref:`View page <user-guide-ui-components-view-pages>` of the entity record, click 
  :guilabel:`Save and Close`
