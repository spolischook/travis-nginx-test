How to create new bundle
========================

*Used application: OroPlatform 1.7*

New bundle can be created either manually, or automatically using standard Symfony console command.


Create bundle manually
----------------------

First you need to specify name and namespace of your bundle. Symfony framework already has
`best practices for bundle structure and bundle name`_ and we recommend to follow these practices and use them.

.. _best practices for bundle structure and bundle name: http://symfony.com/doc/2.3/cookbook/bundles/best_practices.html#bundle-name

Let's assume that we want to create the AcmeNewBundle and put it under the namespace ``Acme\Bundle\NewBundle``
in the ``/src`` directory. We need to create the corresponding directory structure and the bundle file with the following content:

.. code-block:: php
    :linenos:

    <?php
    // src/Acme/Bundle/NewBundle/AcmeNewBundle.php
    namespace Acme\Bundle\NewBundle;

    use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Bundle\Bundle;

    class AcmeNewBundle extends Bundle
    {
    }

Basically, it's a regular Symfony bundle. The only difference is in the way it will be enabled
(see chapter `Enable bundle`_).


Create bundle automatically
---------------------------

Also new bundle can be generated using `Symfony command generate:bundle`_:

.. _Symfony command generate:bundle: http://symfony.com/doc/2.3/bundles/SensioGeneratorBundle/commands/generate_bundle.html

.. code-block:: bash

    user@host:/var/www/vhosts/platform-application$ php app/console generate:bundle
    Bundle namespace: Acme/Bundle/NewBundle
    Bundle name [AcmeNewBundle]:
    Target directory [/var/www/vhosts/platform-application/src]:
    Configuration format (yml, xml, php, or annotation): yml
    Do you want to generate the whole directory structure [no]?
    Do you confirm generation [yes]?

    Generating the bundle code: OK
    Checking that the bundle is autoloaded: OK

    Confirm automatic update of your Kernel [yes]? no
    Enabling the bundle inside the Kernel: FAILED
    Confirm automatic update of the Routing [yes]? no
    Importing the bundle routing resource: FAILED

It is important that you don't need to update Kernel and routing, as OroPlatform provides its own way to do that,
which will be described in the `Enable bundle`_ chapter and in following articles.

.. note::

    Automatic bundle generation is provided by the ``sensio/generator-bundle`` package, which is defined in the
    ``require-dev`` section of the ``composer.json`` file in the OroPlatform repository. Therefore, in order to use
    automatic generation, please, make sure that this package has been installed (one of the ways to do so is to execute
    ``composer update`` at the project's root directory to get all packages from the ``require-dev`` section).


Enable bundle
-------------

Now you have all required files to enable your new bundle. To do that you have to:

#. create file with name Resources/config/oro/bundles.yml with the following
   content:

   .. code-block:: yaml
       :linenos:

       # src/Acme/Bundle/NewBundle/Resources/config/oro/bundles.yml
       bundles:
           - Acme\Bundle\NewBundle\AcmeNewBundle

   This file provides list of bundles to register - all such files will be
   automatically parsed to load required bundles.

#. regenerate application cache using console command cache:clear:

   .. code-block:: bash

       user@host:/var/www/vhosts/platform-application$ php app/console cache:clear
       Clearing the cache for the dev environment with debug true

   .. note::

       If you are working in production environment you have to add parameter
       --env=prod.

Now you can go to frontend in development mode (http://bap.tutorial/app_dev.php/) and click on
`Symfony profiler`_ config icon:

.. _Symfony profiler: http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/internals.html#profiler

.. image:: ./img/how_to_create_new_bundle/dashboard.png

Here you can find your new bundle in the list of active bundles:

.. image:: ./img/how_to_create_new_bundle/profiler.png

That's all - your bundle is registered and active!
