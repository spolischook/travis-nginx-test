How to use WSSE authentication
==============================

*Used application: OroPlatform 1.7*

Overview
--------

*OroPlatform* uses WSSE authentication mechanism to provide secured access for third party applications via REST/SOAP APIs.
It's based on the `EscapeWSSEAuthenticationBundle`_ that covers most cases from the WSSE `specs`_.

.. _EscapeWSSEAuthenticationBundle: https://github.com/escapestudios/EscapeWSSEAuthenticationBundle
.. _specs: http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-soap-message-security-1.0.pdf

API key
-------

An *API key* has been added to the platform in order to prevent usage of regular (raw) user passwords in third party software.
It can be generated for every user on the *"user view"* page by users that have **EDIT** permissions granted.

This key should be used for ``PasswordDigest`` generation on the client side.

Header generation
-----------------

To generate an authentication header the console command ``oro:wsse:generate-header`` should be used.

.. code-block:: bash

    user@host: php app/console oro:wsse:generate-header yourApiKey
    Authorization: WSSE profile="UsernameToken"
    X-WSSE: UsernameToken Username="admin", PasswordDigest="mTe5J+wM7tcBsI2Qx7bnajQ+0lQ=", Nonce="OWRmNWEwZWZiMTcyMTRkNQ==", Created="2014-12-09T21:29:18+02:00"

It has *apiKey* as the required argument and outputs generated headers.
Here is an example of a request using curl:

.. code-block:: bash

       curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H 'Authorization: WSSE profile="UsernameToken"' -H 'X-WSSE: UsernameToken Username="admin", PasswordDigest="buctlzbeVflrVCoEfTKB1mkltCI=", Nonce="ZmMzZDg4YzMzYzRmYjMxNQ==", Created="2014-03-22T15:24:49+00:00"' http://crmdev.lxc/app_dev.php/api/rest/latest/users
       HTTP/1.1 200 OK
       Server: nginx
       Content-Type: application/json
       Transfer-Encoding: chunked
       Connection: keep-alive

       [{"id":1,"username":"admin","email":"admin@example.com","namePrefix":null,"firstName":"John","middleName":null,"lastName":"Doe","nameSuffix":null,"birthday":null,"enabled":true,"lastLogin":"2014-03-22T14:15:19+00:00","loginCount":1,"createdAt":"2014-03-22T13:55:14+00:00","updatedAt":"2014-03-22T14:15:19+00:00","owner":{"id":1,"name":"Main"},"roles":[{"id":3,"role":"ROLE_ADMINISTRATOR","label":"Administrator"}]}]


To generate an authentication header with PHP:

.. code-block:: php
    :linenos:

    $userName = 'your username';
    $userPassword = 'your password';
    $nonce = uniqid();
    $created  = date('c');
    $digest   = base64_encode(sha1(base64_decode($nonce) . $created . $userPassword, true));

    $wsseHeader = "Authorization: WSSE profile=\"UsernameToken\"\n";
    $wsseHeader.= sprintf(
        'X-WSSE: UsernameToken Username="%s", PasswordDigest="%s", Nonce="%s", Created="%s"',
        $userName,
        $digest,
        $nonce,
        $created
    );
    

Header and nonce lifetime
-------------------------

The generated header has a lifetime of 300s and it expires if not used during this time.
Each *nonce* might be used only once in specific time for generation of the *password digest*.
By default, the *nonce* cooldown time is also set to 300s.
This rule is aimed to improve safety of the application and prevent *"replay"* attacks.

Therefore, the header generation algorithm should be implemented on the side of the client application and headers should be re-generated for each request.
