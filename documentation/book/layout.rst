Customizing the Application Layout
==================================

You can customize the OroPlatform layout in different ways:

* :ref:`A simple solution is to load your own CSS files. <book-layout-css-files>`
* :ref:`You can also provide entire themes to change the look and feel <book-layout-themes>`

.. _book-layout-css-files:

Custom CSS Files
----------------

Creating and Embedding Custom Stylesheets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using your own CSS files is pretty simple. Just save them in the, for example,
``Resources/public/css/`` directory of your bundle and list them in the ``assets.yml``
configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:

    # src/Acme/DemoBundle/Resources/config/assets.yml
    css:
        frontend:
            - 'bundles/acmedemo/css/frontend/first.css'
            - 'bundles/acmedemo/css/frontend/second.css'
        backend:
            - 'bundles/acmedemo/css/backend/first.css'
            - 'bundles/acmedemo/css/backend/second.css'

Then, embed your styles in the main layout template using the ``oro_css`` Twig tag:

.. code-block:: html+jinja
    :linenos:

    {% oro_css filter='filters,separated,by,comma' output='css/style.css' %}
        <link rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="{{ asset_url }}" />
    {% endoro_css %}

Now, you need to clear the cache and install the new stylesheets by running the ``assets:install``
command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console cache:clear
    $ php app/console oro:assets:install
    $ php app/console assetic:dump

In this example, all four CSS files from your bundle as well as all the other files from the Oro
Platform and from third party bundles will be merged and dumped in the ``web/css/style.css`` file.
Optionally, you can apply different filters to each CSS file (separate them by comma if you want to
apply multiple filters.

.. seealso::

    Refer to the `Assetic documentation`_ for a list of available filters and read the `cookbook`_
    in the Symfony documentation to learn more about Assetic.

.. _book-layout-debugging-css:

Debugging Your Stylesheets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As you can see in the example above, you can group your CSS files. This is extremely useful when
you have to debug your stylesheets. By default, all CSS files will be merged and minimized in a
single file. If you need to debug certain CSS files, you can exclude groups from the build process
which means that all files belonging to an excluded group won't be merged and compiled.

For instance, the following configuration excludes all files from the ``frontend`` group:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:

    # app/config.yml
    oro_assetic:
        css_debug: [frontend]

.. tip::

    You can run the ``oro:assetic:groups`` command to get a list of all active CSS groups:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ php app/console oro:assetic:groups

.. _book-layout-themes:

Application Themes
------------------

A theme is a set of CSS and/or LESS files that customize the look and feel of OroPlatform. A
theme has the following properties:

==============  ========  ===========================================================
Property        Required  Description
==============  ========  ===========================================================
``name``        yes       A unique name
``label``       no        A string that will be displayed in the theme management UI.
``styles``      yes       The list of CSS and LESS files that define the theme.
``icon``        no        The theme's favicon.
``logo``        no        A logo that will be shown in the theme management UI.
``screenshot``  no        A screenshot of the theme to be shown in the management UI.
==============  ========  ===========================================================

You can create themes in two different ways:

* :ref:`Add application-specific themes. <book-themes-application-themes>`
* :ref:`Create a reusable theme. <book-themes-reusable-themes>`

Alternatively, you can :ref:`customize an existing theme <book-themes-overriding>` instead of
creating a new one from scratch.

.. _book-themes-application-themes:

Application-specific Themes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Customizing the layout of your Platform application is as easy as defining your custom theme in
your application's configuration using the ``oro_theme`` option:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:

    # app/config.yml
    oro_theme:
        themes:
            mytheme:
                styles:
                    - mytheme/css/main.css
                    - mytheme/css/ie.css
                label: My Theme
                icon: mytheme/images/favicon.ico
                logo: mytheme/images/logo.png
                screenshot: /mytheme/images/screenshot.png
        active_theme: mytheme

First, you create a theme named ``mytheme`` whose label is *My Theme* and that makes use of the two
CSS files ``main.css`` and ``ie.css``. Secondly, you just have select the theme to be used by
setting its name as the value of the ``active_theme`` option.

.. _book-themes-reusable-themes:

Reusable Themes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes, you do not only want to customize your own application, but you like to provide a theme
that can be reused in different applications. To achieve this, simply specify the theme's options
in a file named ``settings.yml`` that is located in the ``Resources/public/themes/<theme-name>``
directory of your bundle:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:

    # src/Acme/DemoBundle/Resources/public/themes/acme-theme/settings.yml
    styles:
        - bundles/acmebundle/themes/acme-theme/css/main.css
        - bundles/acmebundle/themes/acme-theme/css/ie.css
    label: Acme Demo Theme
    icon: bundles/acmebundle/themes/acme-theme/images/favicon.ico
    logo: bundles/acmebundle/themes/acme-theme/images/logo.png
    screenshot: bundles/acmebundle/themes/acme-theme/images/screenshot.png

To use the theme in any application, enable it in the application configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:

    # app/config.yml
    oro_theme:
        active_theme: acme-theme

.. tip::

    You can use the ``oro:theme:list`` command to get a list of all available themes. Its output
    looks like this:

    .. code-block:: text

        List of available themes:
        acme-theme (active)
         - label: Acme Demo Theme
         - logo: bundles/acmebundle/themes/acme-theme/images/logo.png
         - icon: bundles/acmebundle/themes/acme-theme/images/favicon.ico
         - screenshot: bundles/acmebundle/themes/acme-theme/images/screenshot.png
         - styles:
             - bundles/acmebundle/themes/acme-theme/css/main.css
             - bundles/acmebundle/themes/acme-theme/css/ie.css
        demo:
         - label: Demo Theme
         - logo: bundles/oroui/themes/demo/images/favicon.ico
         - styles:
             - bundles/oroui/themes/demo/css/less/main.less
             - bundles/oroui/themes/demo/css/style.css
        mytheme
         - label: My Theme
         - logo: mytheme/images/logo.png
         - icon: mytheme/images/favicon.ico
         - screenshot: mytheme/images/screenshot.png
         - styles:
             - mytheme/css/main.css
             - mytheme/css/ie.css
        oro
         - label: Oro Theme
         - icon: bundles/oroui/themes/oro/images/favicon.ico
         - styles: bundles/oroui/themes/oro/css/style.css

Finally, clear the cache and dump all assets:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ php app/console cache:clear
    $ php app/console assets:install
    $ php app/console assetic:dump

.. _book-themes-overriding:

Overriding a Theme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration files of all available themes are merged when the service container is being
compiled. Since the merge process does override values if they are defined in more than one file,
you can make use of it when you are in the need to customize an existing theme.

For example, imagine that you want to use the *Oro* theme from the OroUIBundle, but you want to use
a custom label and favicon for it. The definition of the *Oro* theme as defined in the bundle looks
like this:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:

    label: Oro Theme
    icon: bundles/oroui/themes/oro/images/favicon.ico
    styles:
        - bundles/oroui/themes/oro/css/style.css

All you have to is placing a ``settings.yml`` file in the ``Resources/public/themes/oro`` directory
of your bundle and define the values you want to change:

.. code-block:: yaml
    :linenos:

    # src/Acme/DemoBundle/Resources/public/oro/
    label: Custom Oro Theme
    icon: images/custom_favicon.ico

.. caution::

    If you override themes from third-party bundles, you have to make sure that your bundle is
    registered after the bundle it is overriding themes from:

    .. code-block:: php
        :linenos:

        // app/AppKernel.php
        // ...

        class AppKernel extends OroKernel
        {
            public function registerBundles()
            {
                $bundles = array(
                    // ...
                    new ThirdParty\Bundle\ThirdPartyBundle(),
                    // ...
                    new Acme\DemoBundle\AcmeDemoBundle(),
                    // ...
                );

                // ...
            }

            // ...
        }
