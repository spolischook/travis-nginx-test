architecture allows teams to use the features they need to create their applications. OroPlatform right out of the 
box comes with a lot of useful features so that developers can focus on
building their unique business application in less time. Built on top of the popular Symfony
framework, OroPlatform is completely open source which means that Oro customers will have free
choice in application creation and development.

OroCRM is the revolutionary CRM built on the shoulders of OroPlatform. On top of OroPlatform it adds a variety of 
tools targeted to improve marketing. Customer Segmentation makes it
easy to target customers as they are viewed at across multiple data sets. Customers, orders and
shopping carts can be imported from the company's commerce and marketing systems to view data
across multiple channels and campaigns which can also be created managed within OroCRM. Custom
reports and dashboards fit the need to drive accurate business decisions.
