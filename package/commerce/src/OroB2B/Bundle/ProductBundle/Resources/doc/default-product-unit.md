Default Product Unit
=========================

General Information
===================
In case if category was selected on [first step of product creation](./two-step-product-creation.md), then default product unit and unit precision values will be taken from selected category.
If the product category doesn't have the default product unit set, then parent category will be taken in the category tree until default product unit will be found.
If no default product unit was found in the category tree or category was not selected on first step of product creation, then the value from the system configuration will be taken.
