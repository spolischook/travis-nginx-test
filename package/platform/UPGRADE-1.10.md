UPGRADE FROM 1.9 to 1.10
========================

####TestFrameworkBundle
- All tests run with debug true, hence in case of exception you will see a detailed information about it. Previously it was like on prod.
- All connections, tests internally share one pdo connection to database.
- Oro\Bundle\TestFrameworkBundle\Test\WebTestCase::cleanUpConnections method was removed.
- Oro\Bundle\TestFrameworkBundle\Test\Client::startTransaction method was removed, use one from Oro\Bundle\TestFrameworkBundle\Test\WebTestCase class.
- Oro\Bundle\TestFrameworkBundle\Test\Client::rollbackTransaction method was removed, use one from Oro\Bundle\TestFrameworkBundle\Test\WebTestCase class.
- `\Oro\Bundle\TestFrameworkBundle\Fixtures\LoadUserData` is deprecated, use `\Oro\Bundle\TestFrameworkBundle\Migrations\Data\ORM\LoadUserData` instead
- No need to load fixtures after test environment setup using `doctrine:fixture:load`

####EntityBundle
- The implementation of `Oro\Bundle\EntityBundle\ORM\EntityAliasResolver` was changed. Now the loaded entity aliases is saved into a cache that gives significant performance gain. Also, from now, you can implement `Oro\Bundle\EntityBundle\Provider\EntityClassProviderInterface` to create aliases for any entities not only for ORM entities.

####EntityConfigBundle
- Entity config class metadata now allows any `route*` options, that can be used for CRUD routes configuration - as well as already existing `routeName`, `routeView` and `routeCreate` options.
- Added `Oro\Bundle\EntityConfigBundle\Migration\RemoveManyToOneRelationQuery` as an automated way to remove ManyToOne relation

####DashboardBundle
- Class `Oro\Bundle\DashboardBundle\Provider\Converters\FilterDateTimeRangeConverter` was renamed to `Oro\Bundle\DashboardBundle\Provider\Converters\FilterDateRangeConverter`. Service was not renamed.
- Added new class `Oro\Bundle\DashboardBundle\Provider\Converters\FilterDateTimeRangeConverter`.
- `oro_type_widget_user_multiselect` form type was renamed to `oro_type_widget_user_select` and moved to UserBundle.
- Class `Oro\Bundle\DashboardBundle\Twig\FilterDateRangeExtension` was renamed to `Oro\Bundle\DashboardBundle\Twig\DashboardExtension`. Service was renamed to `oro_dashboard.twig.extension`. Added parameters `Oro\Bundle\QueryDesignerBundle\QueryDesigner\Manager $manager` and `Oro\Bundle\EntityBundle\Provider\EntityProvider $entityProvider` to the constructor.

####DataAuditBundle
- The constructor of the `Oro/Bundle/DataAuditBundle/EventListener/SegmentWidgetOptionsListener` class was changed. Before: `__construct(HttpKernelInterface $httpKernel)`. After: `__construct(HttpKernelInterface $httpKernel, SecurityFacade $securityFacade, ContextChecker $contextChecker)`.

####DataGridBundle
- Events `Oro\Bundle\DataGridBundle\Event\OrmResultBefore` second constructor argument `$query` type changed from `Doctrine\ORM\Query` to `Doctrine\ORM\AbstractQuery`.
- Event `Oro\Bundle\DataGridBundle\Event\OrmResultAfter` third constructor argument `$query` type changed from `Doctrine\ORM\Query` to `Doctrine\ORM\AbstractQuery`.

####EntityBundle
- The constructor of the `Oro\Bundle\EntityBundle\ORM\EntityAliasResolver` class was changed. Before: `__construct(ManagerRegistry $doctrine, $debug)`. After: `__construct(DoctrineHelper $doctrineHelper, ManagerBagInterface $managerBag, $debug)`.
- The constructor of the `Oro\Bundle\EntityBundle\Provider\AllEntityHierarchyProvider` class was changed. Before: `__construct(DoctrineHelper $doctrineHelper, ConfigProvider $extendConfigProvider, EntityManagerBag $entityManagerBag)`. After: `__construct(DoctrineHelper $doctrineHelper, ConfigProvider $extendConfigProvider, ManagerBagInterface $managerBag)`.
- Method `getAllShortMetadata` was added to `Oro\Bundle\EntityBundle\ORM\DoctrineHelper`. Using of this method instead of the `getAllMetadata` method can give significant performance gain.

####ImportExportBundle
- ACL resource (capability) `oro_importexport` was removed. Please, use `oro_importexport_import` or `oro_importexport_export` instead.
- Added parameter `NewEntitiesHelper $newEntitiesHelper` to constructor of `Oro\Bundle\ImportExportBundle\Strategy\Import\ConfigurableAddOrReplaceStrategy`

####SecurityBundle
- **IMPORTANT**: The behaviour of the [Access Decision Manager](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/security/authorization.html#access-decision-manager) was changed. Now the `allowIfAllAbstainDecisions` flag is set to `true` by default. It means that an access to a resource is denied as soon as there is one voter denying access. The goal of this change is to grant access when all voters abstain.
- `Oro\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Acl\Extension\EntityMaskBuilder` - removed all constants for masks and their groups.
- `Oro\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Acl\Extension\EntityMaskBuilder` - now allow custom Permissions (see [permissions.md](./src/Oro/Bundle/SecurityBundle/Resources/doc/permissions.md)

- Added migration `Oro\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Migrations\Schema\LoadBasePermissionsQuery` for loading to DB base permissions ('VIEW', 'CREATE', 'EDIT', 'DELETE', 'ASSIGN', 'SHARE').
- Added migration `Oro\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Migrations\Schema\v1_1\UpdateAclEntriesMigrationQuery` for updating ACL Entries to use custom Permissions.
- Added `acl_permission` twig extension - allows get `Permission` by `AclPermission`.

Updated same method in `Oro\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Acl\Extension\ActionAclExtension` and `Oro\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Acl\Extension\EntityAclExtension`.
- For php version from 7.0.0 to 7.0.5 we replaced `Symfony\Component\Security\Acl\Domain\Entry` on `Oro\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Acl\Domain\Entry` to avoid [bug](https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=71940) with unserialization of an object reference

    **IMPORTANT**: Changing of process cron triggers configuration will not keep all old cron triggers in database. E.g. old triggers would be removed and new created.
- Added class `Oro\Bundle\WorkflowBundle\Handler\WorkflowDefinitionHandler` (`oro_workflow.handler.workflow_definition` service) for single point of `WorkflowDefinition` entity management.
    All manipulations with `Oro\Bundle\WorkflowBundle\Entity\WorkflowDefinition` entity persistence should be provided through the handler.
- Class `Oro\Bundle\WorkflowBundle\Model\WorkflowManager` construction signature was changed: additional (fifth) argument `Symfony\Component\EventDispatcher\EventDispatcherInterface $eventDispatcher` was added.

####CronBundle
- Added action `@create_job` for instance of `JMS\JobQueueBundle\Entity\Job` creation and persistence through actions (Class `Oro\Bundle\CronBundle\Action\CreateJobAction`).

- `Oro\Bundle\SearchBundle\DependencyInjection\OroSearchExtension::mergeConfig` deprecated since 1.9. Will be removed after 1.11.
- `Oro\Bundle\SearchBundle\EventListener\UpdateSchemaDoctrineListener` is no longer requires `Oro\Bundle\SearchBundle\Engine\FulltextIndexManager` as an first argument

####FormBundle
- 'Oro\Bundle\FormBundle\Form\Extension\RandomIdExtension' was renamed to 'Oro\Bundle\FormBundle\Form\Extension\AdditionalAttrExtension'
- 'oro_form.extension.random_id' service was renamed to 'oro_form.extension.additional_attr'
- Form field identifier - 'data-name' attribute generation added to 'AdditionalAttrExtension'
- Method `Oro\Bundle\FormBundle\Model\UpdateHandler::handleUpdate` marked as deprecated. Use `Oro\Bundle\FormBundle\Model\UpdateHandler::update` instead.
- In previous version client of methods `Oro\Bundle\UIBundle\Route\Router::redirectAfterSave` and `Oro\Bundle\FormBundle\Model\UpdateHandler::handleUpdate`
was responsible to pass redirect data in arguments, for example:
```
    return $this->get('oro_ui.router')->redirectAfterSave(
        ['route' => 'oro_calendar_event_update', 'parameters' => ['id' => $entity->getId()]],
        ['route' => 'oro_calendar_event_view', 'parameters' => ['id' => $entity->getId()]]
    );
```
```
    return $this->get('oro_form.model.update_handler')->handleUpdate(
        $trackingWebsite,
        $this->createForm($this->getFormType(), $trackingWebsite),
        function (TrackingWebsite $entity) {
            return [
                'route' => 'oro_tracking_website_update',
                'parameters' => ['id' => $entity->getId()]
            ];
        },
        function (TrackingWebsite $entity) {
            return [
                'route' => 'oro_tracking_website_view',
                'parameters' => ['id' => $entity->getId()]
            ];
        },
        $this->getTranslator()->trans('oro.tracking.trackingwebsite.saved_message')
    );
```
These routes were used to make redirect when user clicked on one of 2 buttons on UI rendered using 2 Twig macroses: saveAndCloseButton and saveAndStayButton.
Now controller's action is not responsible to configure redirect data at all.
```
    return $this->get('oro_ui.router')->redirect($entity);
```
```
    return $this->get('oro_form.model.update_handler')->update(
        $trackingWebsite,
        $this->createForm($this->getFormType(), $trackingWebsite),
        $this->getTranslator()->trans('oro.tracking.trackingwebsite.saved_message')
    );
```
Redirect data is now configured directly in the button rendered in Twig template using macroses: saveAndCloseButton, saveAndStayButton, saveAndNewButton and saveActionButton.

<a href="sample2.jpg" data-gallery="unique-id"></a>
```

- Method `Oro\Bundle\UIBundle\Route\Router::redirectAfterSave` marked as deprecated. Use method `Oro\Bundle\UIBundle\Route\Router::redirect` instead.
- Use of Twig macroses `saveAndCloseButton` and `saveAndStayButton` was changed. In old version client was responsible to pass just a label of button.
In this new version client responsible to specify route and parameters which will be used to make redirect if form will successfully saved.
Before:
```
    {% set html = UI.saveAndCloseButton() %}
    {% if form.vars.value.id or resource_granted('oro_user_user_update') %}
        {% set html = html ~ UI.saveAndStayButton() %}
    {% endif %}
    {{ UI.dropdownSaveButton({'html': html}) }}
{% endblock navButtons %}
```
Now:
```
    {% if resource_granted('oro_user_create') %}
        {% set html = html ~ UI.saveAndNewButton({
            'route': 'oro_user_create'
        }) %}
    {% endif %}
    {% if form.vars.value.id or resource_granted('oro_user_user_update') %}
        {% set html = html ~ UI.saveAndStayButton({
            'route': 'oro_user_update',
            'params': {'id': '$id'}
        }) %}
    {% endif %}
    {{ UI.dropdownSaveButton({'html': html}) }}
{% endblock navButtons %}
```
- New macros `saveAndNewButton` was added and used on most of pages with forms. By clicking on this button user redirects to page with form where a new record could be created.

After: `__construct(DoctrineHelper $doctrineHelper, DirectMailer $mailer, EmailAddressHelper $emailAddressHelper, EmailEntityBuilder $emailEntityBuilder, EmailActivityManager $emailActivityManager, EventDispatcherInterface $eventDispatcher, Mcrypt $encryptor, EmailOriginHelper $emailOriginHelper)`.
- `Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Mailer\Processor::getEmailOrigin` marked as deprecated. Use method `Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Tools\EmailOriginHelper::getEmailOrigin` instead.
- Additional you should use origin as second parameter for `Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Mailer\Processor::process` if you want use specific transport different from system.
- The constructor of the `Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Manager\EmailNotificationManager` class was changed.
    Before: `__construct(EntityManager $entityManager, HtmlTagHelper $htmlTagHelper, Router $router, EmailCacheManager $emailCacheManager, ConfigManager $configManager)`.
    After: `__construct(EntityManager $entityManager, HtmlTagHelper $htmlTagHelper, Router $router, ConfigManager $configManager)`.
- Visibility of method `recipientsFromResult` in `Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Provider\EmailRecipientsHelper` was changed from `protected` to `public`. This can bring a `backward compatibility break` if you have own implementation of this class.

- Added translation strategies to dynamically handle translation fallbacks

####CalendarBundle
- The method `formatCalendarDateRange` of `src/Oro/src/Oro/Bundle/CalendarBundle/Twig/DateFormatExtension.php` class was changed. Argument $dateTimeFormat was deleted, because it has no sense. `calendar_date_range` extension method in twig templates should be called without this param.
