Overview
--------

The action is a set of processors intended to process some request.

Each action has two required elements:

- **context** - an object that is used to store input and output data and share data between processors.
- **main processor** - the main entry point for an action. This class is responsible for creating the context and executing all worker processors.

More details about these elements you can find in the [Creating new action](#creating-new-action) section.

The following table shows all actions provided out of the box:

Please see [processors](./processors.md) section for more details about how to create a processor.

Also you can use the [oro:api:debug](./debug_commands.md#oroapidebug) command to see all actions and processors.

get Action
----------

This action is intended to get an entity by its identifier. More details you can find in [Fetching Data](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching) section of JSON.API specification.

The route name for REST API: `oro_rest_api_get`.

The URL template for REST API: `/api/{entity}/{id}`.

The HTTP method for REST API: `GET`.

The context class: [GetContext](../../Processor/Get/GetContext.php). Also see [Context](#context-class) class for more details.

The main processor class: [GetProcessor](../../Processor/GetProcessor.php).

Existing worker processors: [processors.get.yml](../../Resources/config/processors.get.yml) or run `php app/console oro:api:debug get`.

This action has the following processor groups:

| Group Name | Responsibility&nbsp;of&nbsp;Processors | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| initialize | Initializing of the context | Also the processors from this group are executed when Data API documentation is generated. |
| normalize_input | Preparing input data to be ready to use by processors from the next groups | |
| security_check | Checking whether an access to the requested resource is granted. | If you add a new processor in this group, it should be added in the **security_check** group of actions that execute this action, e.g. look at **security_check** group of [create](#create-action) or [update](#update-action) actions. |
| build_query | Building a query that will be used to load data | |
| load_data | Loading data | |
| normalize_data | Converting loaded data into array | In most cases the processors from this group are skipped because most of entities are loaded by the [EntitySerializer](../../../../Component/EntitySerializer/README.md) and it returns already normalized data. For details see [LoadEntityByEntitySerializer](../../Processor/Shared/LoadEntityByEntitySerializer.php). |
| finalize | Final validation of loaded data and adding required response headers | |
| normalize_result | Building the action result | The processors from this group are executed even if an exception has been thrown by any processor from previous groups. For implementation details see [RequestActionProcessor](../../Processor/RequestActionProcessor.php). |

Creating new action
-------------------

To create a new action you need to create two classes:

- **context** - This class represents an context in scope of which an action is executed. Actually an instance of this class is used to store input and output data and share data between processors. This class must extend [ApiContext](../../Processor/ApiContext.php). Also, depending on your needs, you can use another classes derived from the [ApiContext](../../Processor/ApiContext.php), for example [Context](../../Processor/Context.php), [SingleItemContext](../../Processor/SingleItemContext.php) or [ListContext](../../Processor/ListContext.php).
- **main processor** - This class is the main entry point for an action and responsible for creating an instance of the context class and executing all worker processors. This class must extend [ActionProcessor](../../../../Component/ChainProcessor/ActionProcessor.php) and implement the `createContextObject` method. Also, depending on your needs, you can use another classes derived from the [ActionProcessor](../../../../Component/ChainProcessor/ActionProcessor.php), for example [RequestActionProcessor](../../Processor/RequestActionProcessor.php).

```php
<?php

namespace Acme\Bundle\ProductBundle\Api\Processor;

use Oro\Bundle\ApiBundle\Processor\ApiContext;

class MyActionContext extends ApiContext
{
}
```

```php
<?php

namespace Acme\Bundle\ProductBundle\Api\Processor;

use Oro\Component\ChainProcessor\ActionProcessor;

class MyActionProcessor extends ActionProcessor
{
    /**
     * {@inheritdoc}
     */
    protected function createContextObject()
    {
        return new MyActionContext();
    }
}
```

Also you need to register your processor in the dependency injection container:

```yaml
    acme.my_action.processor:
        class: Acme\Bundle\ProductBundle\Api\Processor\MyActionProcessor
        public: false
        arguments:
            - @oro_api.processor_bag
            - my_action # the name of an action
```

In case if you need to create groups for your action, they should be registered in the ApiBundle configuration. To do this just add `Resources\config\oro\app.yml` to your bundle, for example:

```yaml
oro_api:
    actions:
        my_action:
            processing_groups:
                initialize:
                    priority: -10
                load_data:
                    priority: -20
                finalize:
                    priority: -30
```

Please note that the `priority` attribute is used to control the order in which groups of processors are executed. The highest the priority, the earlier a group of processors is executed. Default value is 0. The possible range is from -254 to 252. Details about creating processors you can find in the [processors](./processors.md#creating-a-processor) section.
