Overview
--------

The configuration declares all aspects related to specific entity. The  configuration should be placed in `Resources/config/oro/api.yml` to be automatically loaded.

All entities, except custom entities, dictionaries and enumerations are not accessible through Data API. To allow usage of an entity in Data API you have to enable it directly. For example, to make `Acme\Bundle\ProductBundle\Product` entity available through Data API you can write the following configuration:

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\ProductBundle\Product: ~
```

If an auto-generated alias for your entity looks bad for you, you can change it in `Resources/config/oro/entity.yml`. More details you can find in [entity aliases documentation](../../../EntityBundle/Resources/doc/entity_aliases.md).

Do not forget to run `oro:api:cache:clear` CLI command to immediately make an entity accessible through Data API. Also please see other [debug commands](./debug_commands.md) that may be helpful.

Configuration structure
-----------------------

To get the overall configuration structure, execute the following command:

```bash
php app/console oro:api:config:dump-reference
```

By default this command shows configuration of nesting entities. To simplify the output you can use the `--max-nesting-level` option, e.g.

```bash
php app/console oro:api:config:dump-reference --max-nesting-level=0
```

The default nesting level is `3`. It is specified in [services.yml](../config/services.yml) via the `oro_api.config.max_nesting_level` parameter. So, if needed, you can easily change this value.

```yaml
parameters:
    # the maximum number of nesting target entities that can be specified in 'Resources/config/oro/api.yml'
    oro_api.config.max_nesting_level: 3
```

The first level sections of configuration are:

* [entities](#entities-configuration-section)   - describes the configuration of entities.
* [relations](#relations-configuration-section)  - describes the configuration of relationships.

Top level configuration example:

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity:
            exclude:
            ...
            fields:
                ...
            filters:
                fields:
                    ...
            sorters:
                fields:
                    ...
            actions:
                ...
            subresources:
                ...
        ...
    relations:
        Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity:
            ...
            fields:
                ...
            filters:
                fields:
                    ...
            sorters:
                fields:
                    ...
        ...
```

"exclude" option
----------------

The `exclude` configuration option describes whether an entity or some of its fields should be excluded from Data API.

Example:

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity1:
            exclude: true # exclude the entity from Data API
        Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity2:
            fields:
                field1:
                    exclude: true # exclude the field from Data API
```

Also the `exclude` option can be used to indicate whether filtering or sorting for certain field should be disabled. Please note that filtering and sorting for the excluded field are disabled automatically, so it's not possible to filter or sort by excluded field.

Example:

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity1:
            sorter:
                fields:
                    field1:
                        exclude: true
            filters:
                fields:
                    field1:
                        exclude: true
```

Please note that `exclude` option are applicable only for Data API. In case if an entity or its' field(s) should be excluded globally use `Resources/config/oro/entity.yml`, e.g.:

```yaml
oro_entity:
    exclusions:
        # whole entity exclusion
        - { entity: Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity1 }
        # exclude field1 of Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\Entity2 entity
        - { entity: Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity2, field: field1 }
```

"entities" configuration section
--------------------------------

The `entities` section describes a configuration of entities.

* **exclude** *boolean* Indicates whether the entity should be excluded from Data API. By default `false`.
* **inherit** *boolean* By default `true`. The flag indicates that the configuration for certain entity should be merged with the configuration of a parent entity. If a derived entity should have completely different configuration and merging with parent configuration is not needed the flag should be set to `false`.
* **exclusion_policy** *string* - Can be `all` or `none`. By default `none`. Indicates the exclusion strategy that should be used for the entity. `all` means that all fields are not configured explicitly will be excluded. `none` means that only fields marked with `exclude` flag will be excluded.
* **max_results** *integer* The maximum number of entities in the result. Set `-1` (it means unlimited), zero or positive number to set the limit. Can be used to set the limit for both root and related entities.
* **order_by** *array* The property can be used to configure default ordering of the result. The item key is the name of a field. The value can be `ASC` or `DESC`. By default the result is ordered by identifier field.
* **disable_inclusion** *boolean* The flag indicates whether an inclusion of related entities is disabled. In JSON.API an [**include** request parameter](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-includes) can be used to customize which related entities should be returned. By default `false`.
* **disable_fieldset** *boolean* The flag indicates whether a requesting of a restricted set of fields is disabled. In JSON.API an [**fields** request parameter](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets) can be used to customize which fields should be returned. By default `false`.
* **hints** *array* Sets [Doctrine query hints](http://doctrine-orm.readthedocs.org/projects/doctrine-orm/en/latest/reference/dql-doctrine-query-language.html#query-hints). Each item can be a string or an array with `name` and `value` keys. The string value is a short form of `[name: hint name]`.
* **identifier_field_names** *string[]* The names of identifier fields of the entity. Usually it should be set in a configuration file in case if Data API resource is based on not ORM entity. For ORM entities a value of this option is retrieved from an entity metadata.
* **post_serialize** *callable* A handler to be used to modify serialized data.
* **delete_handler** *string* The id of a service that should be used to delete entity by the [delete](./actions.md#delete-action) and [delete_list](./actions.md#delete_list-action) actions. By default the [oro_soap.handler.delete](../../../SoapBundle/Handler/DeleteHandler.php) service is used.
* **form_type** *string* The form type that should be used for the entity in [create](./actions.md#create-action) and [update](./actions.md#update-action) actions. By default the `form` form type is used.
* **form_options** *array* The form options that should be used for the entity in [create](./actions.md#create-action) and [update](./actions.md#update-action) actions.

By default the following form options are set:

| Option Name | Option Value |
| --- | --- |
| data_class | The class name of the entity |
| validation_groups | ['Default', 'api'] |
| extra_fields_message | This form should not contain extra fields: "{{ extra_fields }}" |

Example:

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity:
            inherit:              false
            exclusion_policy:     all
            max_results:          25
            order_by:
                field1: DESC
                field2: ASC
            hints:
                - HINT_TRANSLATABLE
                - { name: HINT_FILTER_BY_CURRENT_USER }
                - { name: HINT_CUSTOM_OUTPUT_WALKER, value: "Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\AST_Walker_Class"}
            post_serialize:       ["Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Serializer\MySerializationHandler", "serialize"]
            delete_handler:       acme.demo.test_entity.delete_handler
            excluded:             false
            form_type: acme_entity.api_form
            form_options:
                validation_groups: ['Default', 'api', 'my_group']
```

"fields" configuration section
------------------------------

This section describes entity fields' configuration.

* **exclude** *boolean* Indicates whether the field should be excluded. This property is described above in ["exclude" option](#exclude-option).
* **description** *string* A human-readable description of the field. Used in auto generated documentation only.
* **property_path** *string* The property path to reach the fields' value. Can be used to rename a field or to access to a field of related entity.
* **data_transformer** - The data transformer(s) to be applies to the field value. Can be specified as service name, array of service names or as FQCN and method name.
* **collapse** *boolean* Indicates whether the entity should be collapsed. It is applicable for associations only. It means that target entity should be returned as a value, instead of an array with values of entity fields. Usually this property is set by [get_relation_config](./actions.md#get_relation_config-action) processors to get identifier of the related entity.
* **form_type** *string* The form type that should be used for the field in [create](./actions.md#create-action) and [update](./actions.md#update-action) actions.
* **form_options** *array* The form options that should be used for the field in [create](./actions.md#create-action) and [update](./actions.md#update-action) actions.
* **data_type** *string* The data type of the field value. Can be `boolean`, `integer`, `string`, etc. If a field represents an association the data type should be a type of an identity field of the target entity.
* **meta_property** *boolean* A flag indicates whether the field represents a meta information. For JSON.API such fields will be returned in [meta](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-meta) section. By default `false`.
* **target_class** *string* The class name of a target entity if a field represents an association. Usually it should be set in a configuration file in case if Data API resource is based on not ORM entity.
* **target_type** *string* The type of a target association. Can be **to-one** or **to-many**. Also **collection** can be used as an alias for **to-many**. **to-one** can be omitted as it is used by default. Usually it should be set in a configuration file in case if Data API resource is based on not ORM entity.
* **depends_on** *string[]* A list of fields on which this field depends on. This option can be helpful for computed fields. A result-set will contain this fields even if they are excluded.

Examples:

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity:
            fields:
                # exclude a field

                        - "my.data.transformer.service.id"
                        - ["Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\DataTransformer\MyDataTransformer", "transform"]

                # short syntax for data transformer

                # to-one association
                field7:
                    data_type: integer # the data type of an identifier field of the target
                    target_class: Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Api\Model\AcmeTargetEntity

                # to-many association
                field8:
                    data_type: integer # the data type of an identifier field of the target

                    data_type: string
                    depends_on: [field1]
```

"filters" configuration section
-------------------------------

This section describes fields by which the result data can be filtered. It contains two properties: `exclusion_policy` and `fields`.

* **exclusion_policy** *string* Can be `all` or `none`. By default `none`. Indicates the exclusion strategy that should be used. `all` means that all fields are not configured explicitly will be excluded. `none` means that only fields marked with `exclude` flag will be excluded.
* **fields** This section describes a configuration of each field that can be used to filter the result data. Each filter can have the following properties:
    * **exclude** *boolean* Indicates whether filtering by this field should be disabled. By default `false`.
    * **description** *string* A human-readable description of the filter. Used in auto generated documentation only.
    * **property_path** *string* The property path to reach the fields' value. The same way as above in `fields` configuration section.
    * **data_type** *string* The data type of the filter value. Can be `boolean`, `integer`, `string`, etc.

                    field3:
                        data_type: boolean
                        allow_array: false
```

"sorters" configuration section
-------------------------------

This section describes fields by which the result data can be sorted. It contains two properties: `exclusion_policy` and `fields`.

* **exclusion_policy** *string* Can be `all` or `none`. By default `none`. Indicates the exclusion strategy that should be used. `all` means that all fields are not configured explicitly will be excluded. `none` means that only fields marked with `exclude` flag will be excluded.

            sorters:
                fields:
                    field1:
                        property_path: firstName
                    field2:
                        exclude: true
```

"actions" configuration section
-------------------------------

The `actions` configuration section allows to specify action-specific options. The options from this section will be added to the entity configuration. If an option exists in both entity and action configurations the action option wins. The exception is the `exclude` option. This option is used to disable an action for a specific entity and it is not copied to the entity configuration.

* **exclude** *boolean* Indicates whether the action is disabled for entity. By default `false`.
* **description** *string* A short, human-readable description of API resource. Used in auto generated documentation only.
* **documentation** *string* A detailed documentation of API resource. Used in auto generated documentation only.
* **acl_resource** *string* The name of ACL resource that should be used to protect an entity in a scope of this action. The `null` can be used to disable access checks.
* **max_results** *integer* The maximum number of entities in the result. Set `-1` (it means unlimited), zero or positive number to set the limit. Can be used to set the limit for both root and related entities.
* **order_by** *array* The property can be used to configure default ordering of the result. The item key is the name of a field. The value can be `ASC` or `DESC`. By default the result is ordered by identifier field.
* **page_size** *integer* The default page size. Set a positive number or `-1` if a pagination should be disabled. Default value is `10`.
* **disable_sorting** *boolean* The flag indicates whether a sorting is disabled. By default `false`.
* **disable_inclusion** *boolean* The flag indicates whether an inclusion of related entities is disabled. In JSON.API an [**include** request parameter](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-includes) can be used to customize which related entities should be returned. By default `false`.
* **disable_fieldset** *boolean* The flag indicates whether a requesting of a restricted set of fields is disabled. In JSON.API an [**fields** request parameter](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets) can be used to customize which fields should be returned. By default `false`.
* **form_type** *string* The form type that should be used for the entity.
* **form_options** *array* The form options that should be used for the entity.
* **status_codes** *array* <a id="action-status_codes-configuration-section" />The possible response status codes for the action.
    * **exclude** *boolean* Indicates whether the status code should be excluded for a particular action. This property is described above in ["exclude" option](#exclude-option).
    * **description** *string* A human-readable description of the status code. Used in auto generated documentation only.
* **fields** - <a id="action-fields-configuration-section" />This section describes entity fields' configuration specific for a particular action.
    * **exclude** *boolean* Indicates whether the field should be excluded for a particular action. This property is described above in ["exclude" option](#exclude-option).
    * **form_type** *string* The form type that should be used for the field.
    * **form_options** *array* The form options that should be used for the field.

By default, the following permissions are used to restrict access to an entity in a scope of the specific action:

| Action | Permission |
| --- | --- |
| get | VIEW |
| get_list | VIEW |
| create | CREATE and VIEW |
| update | EDIT and VIEW |
| delete | DELETE |
| delete_list | DELETE |


Examples of `actions` section configuration:

Disable `delete` action for an entity:

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity:
            actions:
                delete:
                    exclude: true
```

Also a short syntax can be used:

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity:
            actions:
                delete: false
```

Set custom ACL resource for the `get_list` action:

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity:
            actions:
                get_list:
                    acl_resource: acme_view_resource
```  

Turn off access checks for the `get` action:

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
       Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity:
            actions:
                get:
                    acl_resource: ~
```

Add additional status code for `delete` action:

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity:
            actions:
                delete:
                    status_codes:
                        '417': 'Returned when expectations failed'
```

or

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity:
            actions:
                delete:
                    status_codes:
                        '417':
                            description: 'Returned when expectations failed'
```

Remove existing status code for `delete` action:

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity:
            actions:
                delete:
                    status_codes:
                        '417': false
```

or

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\AcmeBundle\Entity\AcmeEntity:
            actions:
                delete:
                    status_codes:
                        '417':
                            exclude: true
```

Exclude a field for `update` action:

```yaml

"subresources" configuration section
------------------------------------

The `subresources` configuration section allows to provide options for sub-resources.

* **exclude** *boolean* Indicates whether the sub-resource is disabled for entity. By default `false`.
* **target_class** *string* The class name of a target entity.
* **target_type** *string* The type of a target association. Can be **to-one** or **to-many**. Also **collection** can be used as an alias for **to-many**. **to-one** can be omitted as it is used by default.
* **actions** *array* The actions supported by the sub-resource. This section has the same options as [entity **actions** section](#actions-configuration-section). If an option exists in both [entity **actions** section](#actions-configuration-section) and sub-resource **actions** section the sub-resource option wins.
* **filters** - The filters supported by the sub-resource. This section has the same options as [entity **filters** section](#filters-configuration-section). If an option exists in both [entity **filters** section](#filters-configuration-section) and sub-resource **filters** section the sub-resource option wins.

Example:

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Oro\Bundle\EmailBundle\Entity\Email:
            subresources:
                suggestions:
                    target_class: Oro\Bundle\ApiBundle\Model\EntityDescriptor
                    target_type: collection
                    actions:
                        get_subresource:
                            description: Get entities that might be associated with the email
                        get_relationship: false
                        update_relationship: false
                        add_relationship: false
                        delete_relationship: false
                    filters:
                        fields:
                            exclude-current-user:
                                description: Indicates whether the current user should be excluded from the result.
                                data_type: boolean
```

"relations" configuration section
---------------------------------

The `relations` configuration section describes a configuration of an entity if it is used in a relationship. This section is not used for JSON.API, but can be helpfull for other types of API. This section is similar to the [entities](#entities-configuration-section) section.
