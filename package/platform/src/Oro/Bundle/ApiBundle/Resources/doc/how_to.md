Turn on API for entity
----------------------

By default, API for entities is disabled. To turn on API for some entity, you should add this entity to `Resources/config/oro/api.yml` of your bundle:


```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\ProductBundle\Product: ~
```

Change ACL resource for action
------------------------------

By default, the following permissions are used to restrict access to an entity in a scope of the specific action:

| Action | Permission |
| --- | --- |
| get | VIEW |
| get_list | VIEW |
| delete | DELETE |
| delete_list | DELETE |

In case if you want to change permission or disable access checks for some action, you can use the `acl_resource` option of `actions` configuration section.

For example, lets's change permissions for `delete` action. You can do at `Resources/config/oro/api.yml` of your bundle: 


```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\ProductBundle\Product:
            actions:
                delete:
                    acl_resource: access_entity_view
```

If there is `access_entity_view` ACL resource:

```yaml   
access_entity_view:
    type: entity
    class: Acme\Bundle\ProductBundle\Product
    permission: VIEW
```

As result, the `VIEW` permission will be used instead of `DELETE` permission.


Disable access checks for action
--------------------------------
 
You can disable access checks for some action by setting `null` as a value to `acl_resource` option in `Resources/config/acl.yml`:

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\ProductBundle\Product:
            actions:
                get_list:
                    acl_resource: ~
```
 
Disable entity action
----------------------

When you add an entity to the API, all the actions will be available by default.

In case if an action should not be accessible, you can disable it in `Resources/config/acl.yml`:

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\ProductBundle\Product:
            actions:
                delete:
                    excluded: true
```

Also, you can use short syntax:

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\ProductBundle\Product:
            actions:
                delete: false
```

Change delete handler for entity
--------------------------------

By default, entity deletion is processed by [DeleteHandler](../../../SoapBundle/Handler/DeleteHandler.php).

If your want to use another delete handler, you can set it by the `delete_handler` option in `Resources/config/acl.yml`:

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\ProductBundle\Product:
            delete_handler: acme.demo.product_delete_handler
```

Please note, that the value of `delete_handler` option is the service id.

Also, you can create own delete handler. The handler class must be derived from [DeleteHandler](../../../SoapBundle/Handler/DeleteHandler.php).

Change the maximum number of entities that can be deleted by one request
------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, the [delete_list](./actions.md#delete_list-action) action can delete not more than 100 entities. This limit is set by the [SetDeleteLimit](../../Processor/DeleteList/SetDeleteLimit.php) processor.

If your want to use another limit, you can set it by the `max_results` option in `Resources/config/acl.yml`:

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\ProductBundle\Product:
            actions:
                delete_list:
                    max_results: 200
```

Also you can remove the limit at all. To do this, set `-1` as a value for the `max_results` option:

```yaml
oro_api:
    entities:
        Acme\Bundle\ProductBundle\Product:
            actions:
                delete_list:
                    max_results: -1
```
