What are Actions?
-----------------

Actions provide possibility to assign any operations to:
 - Entity classes;
 - Routes;
 - Datagrids.

Every active action will show button (link) on the corresponded page(s). Button will be displayed only if all described
Pre conditions are met. Action will be performed after click on the button if all described Pre conditions
and Conditions are met. Also after click on button will be shown modal dialog with some fields only if action has config
for form dialog.

Main Entities
-------------

Action consists of several related entities.

* **Action** - main model that contains information about specific action. It contains the most important
information like action related entity classes (f.e. 'Acme\Bundle\DemoBundle\Entity\MyEntity')
or routes ('acme_demo_myentity_view') or datagrids ('acme-demo-grid'). Action can be enabled or disabled.
Other fields of the action contain information about action name, extended options,
order of display buttons. More options see in [Configuration](#configuration).

* **ActionDefinition** - part of the Action model that contains raw data from action's configuration.

* **Action Data** - container aggregated some data, that will be available on each step of Action. Some of values
associated with some Attribute. Those values can be entered by user directly or assigned via Functions.

* **Attribute** - entity that represent one value in Action, used to render field value on a step form.
Attribute knows about its type (string, object, entity etc.) and additional options.
Attribute contains name and label as additional parameters.

* **Condition** - defines whether specific Action is allowed with specified input data. Conditions can be nested.

* **Functions** - operations are assigned to Action and executed when Action is performed.
There are two kind of actions: Pre Functions, Form Init Functions and Functions.
The difference between them is that Pre Functions are executed before Action button redder, Form Init Functions are
executed before Action and Functions are executed after Action.
Actions can be used to perform any operations with data in Action Data or other entities.

How it works?
-------------

Each action relates to the some entity types (i.e. consists full class name) or\and routes of pages
where action should be displayed or\and datagrids. Before page loading Action Bundle chooses actions that
are corresponded to page's entity\route. Then these actions checking for Pre conditions.
If all Pre conditions are met - Action's button is displaying.
After user click on the button - all functions will be executed if pre conditions and conditions are met.

Configuration
-------------

All actions are described in configuration file ``actions.yml`` corresponded bundle.
Look at the example of simple action configuration that performs some action with entity MyEntity.

```
actions:
    acme_demo_expire_myentity_action:                               # action name

```

This configuration describes action that relates to the ``MyEntity`` entity. On the View page (acme_demo_myentity_view)
of this entity (in case of field 'updatedAt' > new DateTime('now')) will be displayed button with label
"adme.demo.myentity.actions.myentity_action". After click on this button - will run postfunction "assign_value" and set
field 'expired' to `true`.
If `form_options` are specified after click on button will be shown form dialog with attributes fields. And functions
will run only on form submit.

Configuration Validation
------------------------

To validate all actions configuration execute a command:

```
php app/console oro:action:configuration:validate
```

**Note:** All configurations apply automatically after their changes on dev environment.


Default Actions
---------------

**Oro Action Bundle** defines several system wide default actions for common purpose. Those are basic CRUD-called
actions for entities:
 
 - `UPDATE` - action to edit entity, using route from `routeUpdate` option of entity configuration.
 - `DELETE` - action for entity deletion, using route from `routeDelete` option of entity configuration

If Default Actions are using in not default application - e.g. `commerce` - routes will be retrieved from
`routeCommerceUpdate` and `routeCommerceDelete` options.

Configs for default actions placed in `Resources/config/action.yml` file under **Oro Action Bundle** directory.

### Questions and Answers

**How I can disable CRUD default action for my Bundle?**

Suppose you need to disable default `DELETE` action for your new entity `MyEntity`.
Here the case which describe the way. You can do this in `actions.yml` under your bundle config resources directory:

```
actions:
    DELETE:
        exclude_entities: ['MyEntity']
```
This will merge addition special condition to default action during config compilation. 
So that default action `DELETE` will not be matched for your entity and will not be displayed as well.

**How I can modify CRUD default action for my Bundle?**
If you need to customize somehow a default (or any other) action. Suppose to change basically its `label`, you can do
thing like that:
 
```
actions:
    my_special_entity_custom_edit:
        extends: UPDATE                         # this is for keeping all other properties same as in default
        label: 'Modify me'                      # custom label
        substitute_action: UPDATE               # replace UPDATE action with current one
        entities: ['MyEntity']                  # replacement will occur only if this action will be matched by entity
        for_all_entities: false                 # overriding extended property for `entities` field matching only
```
Here is custom modification through substitution mechanism. When action pointed in `substitute_action` field will be
replaced by current one.
Additionally there present limitation in field `entities` that will pick this custom action for substitution of default
one only when context will be matched by that entity.
For those who need to make full replacement of action instead of extended copy of it - `extends` field can be omitted
and own, totally custom, body defined.

See [substitution](./configuration-reference.md#substitution-of-action) section in
[config documentation](./configuration-reference.md) for more details.
