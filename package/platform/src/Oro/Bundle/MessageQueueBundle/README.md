# OroMessageQueue Bundle

The bundle integrates OroMessageQueue component.
It adds easy to use configuration layer, register services and tie them together, register handy cli commands.

## Usage

First, you have to configure a transport layer and set one to be default.

```yaml
# app/config/config.yml

oro_message_queue:
    transport:
        default: amqp
        amqp: { host: 'localhost', port: 5672, user: 'guest', password: 'guest', vhost: '/' }
    client: ~
```

Once you configured everything you can start producing messages:

```php
<?php

/** @var Oro\Component\MessageQueue\Client\MessageProducer $messageProducer **/
$messageProducer = $container->get('oro_message_queue.message_producer');

$messageProducer->sendTo('aFooTopic', 'Something has happened');
```

To consume messages you have to first create a message processor:

```php
<?php
use Oro\Component\MessageQueue\Consumption\MessageProcessor;

class FooMessageProcessor implements MessageProcessor, TopicSubscriberInterface
{
    public function process(Message $message, Session $session)
    {
        echo $message->getBody();

        return self::ACK;
        // return self::REJECT; // when the message is broken
        // return self::REQUEUE; // the message is fine but you want to postpone processing
    }

    public static function getSubscribedTopics()
    {
        return ['aFooTopic'];
    }
}
```

Register it as a container service and subscribe to the topic:

```yaml
orocrm_channel.async.change_integration_status_processor:
    class: 'FooMessageProcessor'
    tags:
        - { name: 'oro_message_queue.client.message_processor' }
```

Now you can start consuming messages:

```bash
./app/console oro:message-queue:consume
```

_**Note**: Add -vvv to find out what is going while you are consuming messages. There is a lot of valuable debug info there._


## Internals

### Structure

You can skip it if you are only going to use the component.
The component is split into several layers:

* **Transport** - The transport API provides a common way for programs to create, send, receive and read messages. Inspired by [Java Message Service](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/api/javax/jms/package-summary.html)
* **Router** - An implementation of [RecipientList](http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/RecipientList.html) pattern.
* **Consumption** - the layer provides tools to simplify consumption of messages. It provides a cli command, a queue consumer, message processor and ways to extend it.
* **Client** - provides a high level abstraction. It provides easy to use abstraction for producing and processing messages. It also reduces a need to configure a broker.

### Flow

The client's message producer sends a message to a router message processor.
It takes the message and search for real recipients who is interested in such a message.
Then, It sends a copy of a message for all of them.
Each target message processor takes its copy of the message and process it.

The message itself has headers and body and they change this way while traveling through the system:

### Custom transport

LIf you happen to need to implement a custom provider take a look at transport's interfaces.
You have to provide an implementation for them

### Key Classes

* MessageProducer - The client's message producer, you will use it all the time to send messages
* MessageProcessorInterface - Each class which does the job has to implement this interface
* TopicSubscriberInterface - Kind of EventSubscriberInterface. It allows you to keep a processing code and topics it is subscribed to in one place.
* MessageConsumeCommand - A command you use to consume messages.
* QueueConsumer - A class that works inside the command and watch for a new message and once it is get it pass it to a message processor.
